This family includes proteins such as drosophila saliva, MtN3 involved in root nodule development and a protein involved in activation and expression of recombination activation genes (RAGs). Although the molecular function of these proteins is unknown, they are almost certainly transmembrane proteins. This family contains a region of two transmembrane helices that is found in two copies in most members of the family. This family also contains specific sugar efflux transporters that are essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development. In many organisims it meditaes gluose transport; in Arabidopsis it is necessary for pollen viability; and two of the rice homologs are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter.

It is a transmembrane heme protein with the two heme groups being bound to conserved histidine residues. A cytochrome b-561 homologue, termed Dcytb, is an iron-regulated ferric reductase in the duodenal mucosa. Other homologues of these are also likely to be ferric reductases. SDR2 is proposed to be important in regulating the metabolism of iron in the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.

Members of this family are all membrane bound proteins possessing a pair of repeats each spanning two transmembrane helices connected by a loop. The PQ motif found on loop 2 is critical for the localization of cystinosin to lysosomes. However, the PQ motif appears not to be a general lysosome-targeting motif. It is thought likely to possess a more general function. Most probably this involves a glutamine residue. Family members are membrane transporters since two members, cystinosin and PQLC2, transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. The 2nd PQ-loop of cystinosin hosts the substrate-coupled H+ binding site underlying its H+ symport mechanism, suggesting that PQ-loop repeats have functional significance. It is thus likely that PQ-loop-containing proteins act as a family of membrane transporters. Some transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. Others transport lysine and or arginine across the lysosomal membrane in order to maintain the acidic homoeostasis.

HAMP is a signaling domain which occurs in a wide variety of signaling proteins, many of which are bacterial. The HAMP domain consists of two alpha helices connected by an extended linker. The structure of the Af1503 HAMP dimer from Archaeoglobus fulgidus has been solved using nuclear magnetic resonance, revealing a parallel four-helix bundle; this structure has been confirmed by cross-linking analysis of HAMP domains from the Escherichia coli aerotaxis receptor Aer. It has been suggested that the four-helix arrangement can rotate between the unusually packed conformation observed in the NMR structure and a canonical coiled-coil arrangement. Such rotation may coincide with signal transduction, but a common mechanism by which HAMP domains relay a variety of input signals has yet to be established.

Known prosthetic groups bound in the S-box domain include heme in the oxygen sensor FixL, FAD in the redox potential sensor NifL, and a 4-hydroxycinnamyl chromophore in photoactive yellow protein. Proteins containing the domain often contain other regulatory domains such as response regulator or sensor histidine kinase domains. Other S-box proteins include phytochromes and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. [Regulatory functions, Small molecule interactions].

Members of this family are all membrane bound proteins possessing a pair of repeats each spanning two transmembrane helices connected by a loop. The PQ motif found on loop 2 is critical for the localization of cystinosin to lysosomes. However, the PQ motif appears not to be a general lysosome-targeting motif. It is thought likely to possess a more general function. Most probably this involves a glutamine residue. Family members are membrane transporters since two members, cystinosin and PQLC2, transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. The 2nd PQ-loop of cystinosin hosts the substrate-coupled H+ binding site underlying its H+ symport mechanism, suggesting that PQ-loop repeats have functional significance. It is thus likely that PQ-loop-containing proteins act as a family of membrane transporters. Some transport cystine and cationic amino acids, respectively, across the lysosomal membrane. Others transport lysine and or arginine across the lysosomal membrane in order to maintain the acidic homoeostasis.

Members of this subfamily display varying domain architectures but all contain double PDC (PhoQ/DcuS/CitA) sensor domains. This model represents the first PDC domain of Diguanylate-cyclases (DGCs), Histidine kinases (HKs), and other similar domains. Many members of this subfamily contain a C-terminal DGC (also called GGDEF) domain. DGCs regulate the turnover of cyclic diguanosine monophosphate. HK receptors are part of two-component systems (TCS) in bacteria that play a critical role for sensing and adapting to environmental changes. Typically, HK receptors contain an extracellular sensing domain flanked by two transmembrane helices, an intracellular dimerization histidine phosphorylation domain (DHp), and a C-terminal kinase domain, with many variations on this theme. In the case of HKs, signals detected by the sensor domain are transmitted through DHp to the kinase domain, resulting in the phosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue in DHp; phosphotransfer to a conserved aspartate in its cognate response regulator (RR) follows, which leads to the activation of genes for downstream cellular responses.

This family includes proteins such as drosophila saliva, MtN3 involved in root nodule development and a protein involved in activation and expression of recombination activation genes (RAGs). Although the molecular function of these proteins is unknown, they are almost certainly transmembrane proteins. This family contains a region of two transmembrane helices that is found in two copies in most members of the family. This family also contains specific sugar efflux transporters that are essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development. In many organisims it meditaes gluose transport; in Arabidopsis it is necessary for pollen viability; and two of the rice homologs are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter.
